# a-third-person-based-affective-spatial-task
Humans use cognitive maps to perceive environment and rely on attention sampling to interact with threats in the environment. However, how these behaviors are influenced by different affective states remains largely unknown. The affective spatial task is designed to address these issues.

In behavioral level:
the task supports to investigate the change in attention sampling periodicity as a function of protection/threat levels.

In cognitive neuroscience level:
the task supports to investigate:
1. The hierarchical representation of affective composition and sequence in human brain.
2. How the representation of conceptual sequences and brain networks change as a function of protection/threat.
3. The relationships between periodic activity in the entorhinal cortex and protection/threat levels.

In the task, human subjects interact with an affective space by pressing buttons to collect virtual coins for rewards. The space consists of three flower bushes arranged in a circular pattern. Each flower bush, distinguished by a unique color, represents a pair of protection and threat levels. Subjects have a probability of acquiring protection when approaching a flower bush from certain directions and may be attacked by an enemy if the threat level is higher than the protection level. In such cases, subjects need to press a button to crouch and evade the enemy’s attack; failing to do so will result in a loss of coins. Conversely, if the protection level exceeds the threat level, no evasion is required. To maximize rewards, subjects must learn the relationships between the flower’s color, protection level, and threat level, while also staying alert to enemy attacks.
